<b>Marco Reus </b>(born 31 May 1989) is a professional footballer
who plays as an attacking midfielder, winger or striker for German club Borussia Dortmund and the Germany national team.
Reus is known for his versatility, speed and technique.<br><br>

Reus spent his youth career at Borussia Dortmund , prior to leaving for Rot Weiss Ahlen. He has played for three clubs
in his senior career, most notably—and with the most influence—in Borussia Mönchengladbach of the Bundesliga. Reus
plays primarily as a left attacker for BVB, however, he is capable of playing on the right also and through the middle,
due to his ability to closely control the ball with both feet. 2012 was his most successful season when,
scoring 18 and assisting eight, he helped Borussia Mönchengladbach secure a place in the following season's UEFA Champions
League. Reus agreed a move to his home club Borussia Dortmund at the end of that season. Reus wears number 11 for Dortmund.
